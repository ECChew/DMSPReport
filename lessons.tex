\section{Requirement verification}
The top level requirements were already defined at the beginning of the project. In the end of the project it was verified whether the requirements were fully fulfilled, partially fulfilled or not fulfilled (See \autoref{tab:reqverif}). Some of the requirements have to be confirmed (TBC), since the result can only be stated after first launch.
