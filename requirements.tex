\chapter{Requirements}
\qquad The top level requirements for the vehicle and propulsion system are divided in three categories: operation, environment and vehicle. The operation requirements are related to the propulsion system and its applicability for the planned missions. The environmental requirements are defined to ensure that both the vehicle and propulsion system is capable of operating and sustaining during launch, mission and in space environment. The scope of the vehicle requirements is to cover the major parts of the planned mission as refuel-ability, aero braking or accuracy. \\
