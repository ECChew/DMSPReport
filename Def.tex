\chapter{Definition}
\section{Vehicle requirements}

%TL-10 The engine shall be the main propulsion system of a GEO satellite recovery vehicle.

%TL-11 The vehicle shall be refuelable between missions.

%TL-12 The vehicle shall be able to perform aerobreak maneauvers in earth's atmosphere.

%TL-13 The vehicle shall be able to manipulate it's flight path in earth's atmosphere using non-propulsive flight control systems.

%TL-14 The vehicle shall remain within the ARIANE 5 payload launch capabilities to LEO.

%TL-15 The vehicle shall be able to withstand debris impact of objects under 1cm of diameter with a maximum relative speed of 15km/s

%TL-16 The vehicle shall be able to remain on it's guided trajectory with less than 0.1 $\%$ deviation.

\section{Operationnal requirements}
%Reliability oriented then cost, performance is a bit less important as it's okay if the mission takes more time

%TL-1 The engine shall be able to provide sufficient thrust for completion of the mission profile including a safety margin.

%TL-2 The engine shall be re-ignitable at least 1000 times.

%TL-3 The engine shall have a service life time of at least 100 missions or 25 years in orbit.

%TL-4 The engine's ignition and functional reliability shall be higher than 99,5$\%$.

\subsection{Environment}

%TL-5 The engine shall be able to withstand the launch phase.

%TL-6 The engine shall be able to operate in vacuum.

%TL-7 The engine shall be able to operate in an ambient temperature range of 1K to 5K.

%TL-8 The engine shall be able to withstand the temperature gradients resulting from areas turned towards or away from the sun.

%TL-9 The engine shall be able to sustain space-related radiation throughout it's complete life time.

Overall, our mission will take our spacecraft between the higher layers of the Earth's atmosphere to the geostationary orbit. Thus, we will often be in a void environment which has particular effects that we need to take into account.
\subsubsection{Thermal effects}
Among those effects is the thermal problem. In space, there are only two ways of exchanging heat :
\begin{itemize}
	\item Conduction
	\item Radiation 
\end{itemize}
This has an impact on our thermal control system as we need to keep our temperature stable with a low ambient temperature but a temperature close to Earth's surface inside.
